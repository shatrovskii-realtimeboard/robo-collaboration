00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.055
We’ve also gathered some
information on the board

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:06.790
so you can learn more
about what you can do in Miro.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.397
Get started with your
own board

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:10.144
by browsing the template library

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:13.084
which is at the top
of the toolbar on the left.

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:14.305
And that’s it!

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:17.516
You’re ready to be set free in
the vast expanses

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.897
of Miro’s infinite boards.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:22.524
Be free. Run wild.

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:24.633
Bye.
